I: Do you know of any tools that could have automated any of the changes you did?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I saw the safe delete. Probably it could have helped me.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: Have you used it before?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
No I haven't. Just because I prefer to do it like I said.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: Anything else?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Not that I can think about.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: Any changes you could have gotten wrong?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I said I thought I did something wrong with the tests and the reason was that before deleting I should have left the old method there just for the sake of it. There were so many variants of this method so i got confused if the method I was changing was actually the right one. But when I got back and doublechecked the names I found that this was being checked and that I should be fine as long as I get a green bar.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
T3 [52:21],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
tests .. test field .. ouch so many fields.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I have a test a field name and force access.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
The first I will probably do is to check where this variable is being used and I'm just relying on the highlighting.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: Can I first ask you to explain to me what you are supposed to do?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I must remove the option of forceaccess and that means that I cannot access fields any more I hope. All the fields should be protected.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: Where do you need to remove it from?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
The getFieldMethod.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: I'm just going to correct you in that it must be removed from the entire class.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Huge.. there's a bunch of them.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I'm just scrolling down to see if there are any other ones. I'm just looking at all the callees of readfield and it's funny because this guy over here where was it. getField.. yes. Field.setaccessible true. or else return false. is it the same as this one? No something different. [57:16],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I wonder what this does. Setaccessible. I'm just navigating between the two of them.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: What are you looking for? [57:49],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
forceaccess checks the accessible... so in getField I'm setting field.setAccessible to true. And probably somewhere else when I call getField I'll probably check these options. [58:57],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I understand what I have to do. If I am providing an API I would probably just change this flag from setAccessible true to false and add a warning here because that means that the clients that are using my API are still able to without .. I mean they would still have an older version but at least people expecting the same behavior would get an error or warning. And I don't necessarily need to delete that field there. But I'm not sure if that's what the task is asking for.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: I understand what you mean but in this case I want you to remove it. [1:00:00],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Ok. I understand what is happening and the last thing is before I'm deleting something - I am getting more familiar with this - and I want to see how many times this thing is used. So getField has a tree fieldUtils .. one two three.. wait where is the last parameter here? is it optional?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
find usages..,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
that was somewhere else.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
So where was I? I didn't see that in this one. Oh this one is getField..,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
This is a bit more challenging because .. not sure what the behavior of this method is.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Now I am trying to see if there is a method that tests forceaccess with true and what is the expected behavior. [1:02:34],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
The ones with illegal should still be there.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
This method has to have the opposite behavior. I'm not sure if I should just delete this. Is this the only place where it is true? I think so.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Now I kind of have an idea of both classes and how they work so now I can delete the things. [1:03:39],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
This was an override in all of these guys. All of these should be have the other method signature. I am deleting the one with three fields. And checking if there is references to the other one. Not sure.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Now it should be over here. [1:04:30],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
ok.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
This returns a field there is a match and then I return the match. field.. classhierarchy. I'm wondering if this is because of the forceaccess.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: did you undo your change?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Yes sorry I undid. There was a different name where the field matched another name in the method and I checked what was being returned. And where you see match it should be field. So this should look like this. And now I can see where it's being used. Forceaccess is not being used any more. I'm curious about this one.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I deleted this part with forceaccess but there is the other part that I don't know what does modifier is public so I'll leave it there.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Now I want to check this one. For the test class testGetfieldforceaccess. This does not exist anymore so I can delete it safely.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
For this one ... I'm not sure if illegalargument is because of the forceaccess or not so i'll just remove this. And hopefully there is a testgetfieldILlegallargumenttest [1:07:57],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
without the forceaccess.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
1 2 3 4 that's perfect. So technically these two guys would look the same. This is the forceaccess. It's new and none. This is being tested by the other one.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
there is still the declared field.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
can delete this guy. [1:08:52],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
if forceaccess.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
There is another method with the same signature. So again I should move this to the other one.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
by the way these two I'm not sure.. I deleted the method and I saw an error in the documentation that I did't see before and I hope I updated the documentation in the other one.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: why do you mean by updating the documentation?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I can double check in here.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
In the previous task I was deleting this method and I think it was fine but I think this was the first time I thought about the documentation - but I would have had to ensure that the documentation was right.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
getDeclaredField .. [1:10:55],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
they are the same so I can delete.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I hope that is not too tedious for you.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
There is a bunch of compile errors here.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Forceaccess readfield.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
When I delete this I'll see more stuff.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Yep it never ends. [1:11:54],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: Why did you undo the delete you just did?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I saw too many compile errors.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: How did you decide that it was too many?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
By the number of red lines I saw over here.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: Did you count?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
If there was three or four.. when I deleted the big method I think it was like five illegalargment but this one as soon as I delete here. [1:12:54],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: that's too many?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
That's too many. That'll probably guide me to one of these guys. What is the name of this guy? ReadField.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Find usages. [1:13:21],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
There is 26 usages. so this is forceaccess. It should be fine to remove this one. [1:13:42],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Then I get a bunch of invalid. And I have more in the writeFieldForceAccess. These guys can go as well. I'm double checking that all of them are true.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
get a bunch of invalid. And I have a readfield with false. Now I can remove this. [1:14:28],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Hm this is interesting.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: What did you notice?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I think I deleted something here probably?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I'm double checking that. [1:15:22],,git diff,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
getDeclaredFields . Yeah.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: Can you explain what happened?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I deleted.. readfield calls readfield with three arguments and here it is calling itself and that's interesting because I forgot that I had deleted it so I thought I was calling something else. Now that this is not being used I have this grayish line [1:16:03] so I know that nothing is using it so that means that I can use this somewhere else. That's basically what I thought. This guy calls this other one. This should be the last one I need to change. Return readField. Forgot one line [1:16:35],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Wait what?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
How.. [1:16:49],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I have readfield and even in this one it calles itself? It is false here.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Where are the return statements of this thing?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Return readfield and it is false. This is weird. Now I have to get back to my git diff. I don't understand.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: What don't you understand?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
In the readfield method I should return something and I don't get how it is calling itself and this is working.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: What are you looking for in your diff?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I want to see the old signature. [1:18:17],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: How do you make sure that it is the same method here?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
There is just the name. I call it with three then I should have the delete.. getField getField.. [1:18:57],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
This should return something [1:19:13],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Target field.. forceaccess.. this is really weird. So technically this should work. [1:20:01],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Last one. GetDeclaredfield. Should have no forceaccess.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
writeDeclaredField. then I can delete this one. [1:20:44],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
And final one. Should be this one. So I have forceaccess here. getField.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Forceaccess getDeclaredField.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: Now you're moving between compiles errors?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Yes I am moving between compiler errors. And I'm undoing because I saw too many errors here on this side. [1:21:23],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: When you notice too many errors and you undo what is your next step?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Often try to locate a different place to work. Right now writeField is smaller than the others and that's where I am going to .. true.. delete this. There is one last guy I can call this without forceacces. Yes.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
So because I made too many changes so far I'll run this to see how bad things are. [1:22:27],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: What do you mean?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I made too many changes and I am not sure about that. Ideally I should have changed one method signature tested changed one method signature tested and so on. But it's not that bad because now I have only one test failing. And I want to see what's happening in this one.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
test.. file..readfield.. [1:23:13],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Ok.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
And I have an error. Pass fields. Read file. Wait.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
This value is not being used that's wrong.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
*counts* [1:24:07],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I think I forgot to copy something so I'll just double check.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I undid because when I ran this test I got an error so I was checking this past behavior. [1:24:56],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
if forceaccess. I don't have forceaccess any more so this should be like this.. [1:25:13],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Then there is another one. I will run this again.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Yep it's still there. Probably I don't know .. readFile. TestWriteReadfield .. How many parameters do I have here? 1 2 3. 1 2 3. Oh ok.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: What did you realise?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Just method override. I'm getting rusty with it. I was deleting stuff and moving stuff around. Then it seems that these are getting the class and the field and the field is not null. So now I can writeField - test the field object - and then target value I think.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
And this should work.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: Why do you think you had to write that?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
There is a lot of override in this class so when I was deleting and moving things around I didn't realise that. On one hand it is nice because I can learn more about the code and how this works in case I need to do that more in the future. [1:28:20],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
A few minutes ago when I was in getField or readField I was like how does this work. This one calls itself. It's actually not it's calling someone else. The only thing that this method does the one with object readfield object [1:29:06],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
it casts this target object to the field class and then it calls the other one. I wondered how it wasn't getting a stackoverflow but now I realise that it is passing it on to someone else. I would not have noticed that if I was relying on automatic refactoring tools.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
On one hand it may take longer for me to do the task but on the other I am getting more familiar with the code.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I think there is one last it's the one that I went 'woops' when I deleted. But now I know that when I delete it there should be more than one place to refer to.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
This one does the casting as well. [1:30:35],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: I'm curious about something. You first deleted the parameter even though you were going to delete the method signature. Why did you do that?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I don't know. What did I do? [1:31:11] Oh yeah. As soon as I do that that means I'll get a compile error of yet another method with the same signature. So this one target and fieldname is the same as this one so I know where this one has to be moved to. then that's ..,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: So just to help you navigate?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Yes.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: Was it kind of a wasted action otherwise? Since you were going to delete it anyway.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Otherwise I wouldn't have known where to move it to.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I think there is one last guy with forceacces. I did find .. [1:32:02],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
yes this one. This should be removed. [1:32:16],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
setfield accessible true,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Again I have the error and I know ..readfield target. [1:32:53],,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Where was I?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
DeclaredField.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Wait.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I: What are you doing now?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
I'm trying to find the last forceaccess but when I deleted it I saw something weird. There were errors in more than one place. So this readField it might be used by a lot of guys. Find usages.

There was a forceaccess method signature and all the other methods were calling that one with the parameter set to false.

When I'm doing a refactoring or let's pick the least complex example and expand from there. Say extract constant I use that refactoring because if I say replace all I see all occurrences and I see all of them flagged in that file. And that is stepwise for me because I see all the places the tool is touching and I can jump there later. But if a tool is like move to caller I want to see what kind of block is going to be moved and who else calls this function or at least see all the places of usages so I can touch these places later. Because otherwise how can I delete this and know where else needs to be checked. All these examples required deleting tests but none required flipping behavior. If a tool do not point me to a place where the flipping needs to happen then I would have the problem of doing a refactoring and not knowing if the behavior of the test should be the same or the behavior of the code.,"Reflection

I: What do you mean with flipping behavior?,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
Say you have return true and you have a bunch of tests with expect x to be true and because of some feature it should be false. When I run this code all of these tests will be broken. Some of the refactoring tools move the code and when I run the tests later I get an error and I don't know if I have to update the tests or. Ideally I would want to see all the places before doing anything. That's one of the reason I was flipping between. I wanted to only delete the tests when I was sure they were disposable. This should not be deleted this should be expect x to be false. [1:55:23] Right.,,,0,0,0,0,0,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
So ideally I would first update these guys before doing anything here so when I run them after the refactoring I would still get a green bar. And I expect tools to help me with that. When I say I'm moving these somewhere else I would expect the tool to say these are being used by x y z do you want to take a look at this? Or leave it there and let me navigate through the code.
