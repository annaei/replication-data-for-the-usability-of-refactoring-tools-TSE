I don't want a button that just says it's done and then I don't know where unless I do a git diff or something like that.
I: You said that you wanted the tool to be very stepwise what did you mean with that?
When I'm doing a refactoring or let's pick the least complex example and expand from there. Say extract constant I use that refactoring because if I say replace all I see all occurrences and I see all of them flagged in that file. And that is stepwise for me because I see all the places the tool is touching and I can jump there later. But if a tool is like move to caller I want to see what kind of block is going to be moved and who else calls this function or at least see all the places of usages so I can touch these places later. Because otherwise how can I delete this and know where else needs to be checked. All these examples required deleting tests but none required flipping behavior. If a tool do not point me to a place where the flipping needs to happen then I would have the problem of doing a refactoring and not knowing if the behavior of the test should be the same or the behavior of the code.
I: What do you mean with flipping behavior?
Say you have return true and you have a bunch of tests with expect x to be true and because of some feature it should be false. When I run this code all of these tests will be broken. Some of the refactoring tools move the code and when I run the tests later I get an error and I don't know if I have to update the tests or. Ideally I would want to see all the places before doing anything. That's one of the reason I was flipping between. I wanted to only delete the tests when I was sure they were disposable. This should not be deleted this should be expect x to be false. [1:55:23] Right.
So ideally I would first update these guys before doing anything here so when I run them after the refactoring I would still get a green bar. And I expect tools to help me with that. When I say I'm moving these somewhere else I would expect the tool to say these are being used by x y z do you want to take a look at this? Or leave it there and let me navigate through the code.

It was obvious just from looking at what it said it was going to do, I click on it and it does it, it did what I would have done manually, and it did it faster. For any refactoring that was more complex than those, maybe I did it once or twice, it didn't do what I envisioned that it would do, so I had a miss of expectations there, and it didn't increase my productivity, it got in my way, by doing something I didn't want.","Reflection

I don't really expect the tool to warn me about that of thing.
I: What would you say are dealbreakers for you when using tools?
The main thing is that I understand what the tool is trying to do. Or the tool behaves in a way that I predict. It's that predictability. I generally don't want a tool to do things that I would never want to do. So like, there are like, repeated patterns that as you work as an SE, you find that you're often doing these operations and they are repetitive, and you'd like them for them to be automated in a nice way. These operations are often simple things, because the simple things are what you do most commonly, and so for the more complex things, you see some complex operation and you think that is automatable. But because it is more complex, there is more variance in what outcomes you actaully want, and so I shy away from those kind of things.
It's about trust and predictability.
I: What do you mean by trust?
That I trust it will be realiable. If something has a lot of variability in what it could do, I can't predict or trust that the outcome will be what I want. Then I have to spend a bunch of time verifying that what it did is what I want, and I'd rather just do what I want instead of ask a computer to do something that I might want and then check to see if it's what I want and then correct it to be what I want, that seems like more effort.","Reflection

Sometimes it's still worth it to use the refactoring tool and find the remaining call sites myself but I know that I need to do my own search after to either verify or complete the remained of the transformation.

Sure. Refactoring tools where I can undo the change is fine. That's very low cost to actually try. Very occasionally I'll do a refactoring that doesn't have an undo option and that is frustrating. I am comfortable using a tool that isn't necessarily 100% correct when it tells me. There are all sorts of nice clever automated code changes that I'll use that aren't safe.

The only hiccup was, I thought - like I did make a mistake about the javadoc, I'm glad I caught that. That is very likely to have slipped past me. [1:09:08]
I: Do you know of any tools that could have automated any of the things you did? [1:09:15]
No. But when we were having this discussion earlier we saw something that said refactor change signature. It has parameters. So .. this leads me to believe that this would serve my purposes. I'm curious as to what it would do different from me just deleting it. [1:09:47] It would probably have some interactive editor, where it's like, you want to delete this parameter but it's being used here, what do you want to do. But to me that's not very different from what I did. I deleted the parameter, things turned red, and it turning red is the same as the editor asking me what do you want to do now that this is broken.

[1:25:21]
I: You mentioned that you usually use some refactoring tools, for example rename.
Sometimes, but not always. I found cases, especially with IntelliJ 2018 and forward, it's too aggressive. It renames too much. Let's say I have a method name, the same as some end point name being stored in a string, which is the same as some documentation stored in a comment. When I click refactor, rename, if I'm not cognisent of the end point it is going to rename that. Unless I have a complete model of the entire program, it is very likely that it will rename such strings. Sometimes it comes up with the view we talked about before, saying this is where it's being used, this is where its being used. I don't like that view. [1:26:36]
It would be nicer if it almost brought up like a slideshow showing all the places it's being used, and I could click through them and go like, oh, that's an endpoint, I don't want it there. Although, if the project is sufficiently large, that could become really inconvenient, that could be worse. If I could just get a slideshow like, within this package, that would be nice.
So I do use it, but I wouldn't say I'm 100% confident with it. I don't always trust it. [1:27:12]
I: Why do you mean by that, not trusting it.
I'm afraid it's going to do that thing where it's going to rename something in a string and break my program, or rename something in the documentation in some way that I don't want it to. Luckily with version control I can see these things. But sometimes it's easier to look for the references because it's just where it's being called, and I can just .. like, use that global search. Sounds bad when I say it now, but I'll do something like this.. [1:28:10]
If I do this, I'm more confident because I can see that these are all the method calls, I can go in and just replace one at the time. And this has an equivalent, ctrl shift r. And I can put this in here, and just go through and replace replace replace. [1:28:45]
I: This is a textual replace, right.
Yes. This, to me, in many ways feels safer, because I get a preview of what's happening as I'm doing it. While the global rename happens everywhere and I just have to trust that it did the right thing. I guess this is the exact slideshow I am describing. This is how I want things to be replaced when I'm afraid. [1:29:07]","Reflection

This is one of the benefits, if you have a refactoring tool you trust, is that it can make sure these are correct. But making sure it exposes the changes it is going to make, and why, is a pretty big deal. That's one thing I always have. 
 The idea of visibility and knowing that is going on, is very important for me, rather than seeing it after the fact.
I could always go and use the tool and use git to see what actually changed along the way..
I: Why don't you like that approach?
Sometimes inspecting changes after the fact can be hard. There is going to be code that is unrelated to your refactoring, since normally refactoring tasks is done as part of other tasks. When you're looking at it after the fact you may also not be able to undo it if something doesn't look right, so it's better to have the information up-front. [23:46]
As you see here, because the refactoring tool added static to my method, the first test that I actually moved it won't run.
Where is that one? 
 testIsAllBlank
so, as a part of this, you can see that using the refactoring tool actually does break the code functionally. If it wasn't on a test it could have had a different impact, but because it is a test it is a little different.
I: It prompted you about making it static though.
But when I said no, it didn't allow it. When I said no, it stopped the refactoring, so you either have to say yes, or not use it. If you say no it does not allow the refactoring, so therefore we had to go with it. But that's also why I reverted it, because I didn't like what it was doing.
I: Did you expect it to break the test?
I would not expect a refactoring to break a test especially for a move. That's bad.","Reflection

There is already another method that way, which means that - it may actually - it will collide - what I'll do in a lot of cases is go back and see what does that one do. It just sets it to false. Something that - I'd take two different approaches is to delete this method right off the bat. Another is kind of similar to what I did in the last one.

Kind of back to the same, understanding to happen. When I go ahead and do this, in the preview here I can see some of what's going on, and it's not necessarily just breaking it, it's kind of seeing it in different ways. Like when I break things and go and look at the errors, I should be able to get some of the same context here. Instead of having to manually delete everything by hand.

I: what is success in this case.
When you don't have to go back and doing a whole bunch of fixes on what it did - like removing static in the first case. Those kinds of things are like, if it starts working and your verification steps are all successful for a while, you just start accepting. I'll never really distrust a rename, I just expect it to work and I've used it so many times. When you get into the different refactorings you may learn that there are certain cases it is good for and certain cases it is not, so you learn what your level of trust is based on experience.
I: Do you have any examples to make that statement more concrete.
Maybe not for refactoring tools, but, I work with customers all day, and there's the saying you trust it as far as you can throw it. In the start you don't know how much you can trust it. The more you can use something and understand what it's doing, the more you gain trust it. You start small, and as you start to trust it you grow it bigger, and I think that's a common pattern with software. It takes time until you know whether something will work better.
I: So for refactoring tools you'd trust the 'smaller' one more?
right of the bat I'd trust the simpler one, like rename - because it is like a find and replace in a way right, just a bit smarter - it's easier to trust those ones, but it's not to say I wouldn't try the other ones and figure out my trust based on their utility. It also depends on how often you do it. If you use something only once or twice it is hard to build an understanding or trust for it, but if it is something you use daily or weekly it's something you can start to get a feeling for and understand your trust level for.","Reflection
